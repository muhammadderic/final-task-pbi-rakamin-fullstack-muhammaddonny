# About Photo Manager API

Creating a Backend API with Golang for my first project introduces me to essential web development concepts like routing, handling HTTP requests, and database integration

## Functionalities

1. User registration and login + User validation input
2. User authorization using JWT (for accessing photo manager)
3. Basic photo manager (upload, edit, and delete)

## Depedencies

- [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin): A web framework that simplifies routing, middleware, and request handling in Go applications.
- [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm): An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that helps interact with databases in a structured and efficient way.
- [go-mysql driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql): A MySQL driver for Go that enables communication between Go applications and MySQL databases, facilitating database operations.
- [jwt-go](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt): A library for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Go, useful for implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt): A library for hashing passwords securely, commonly used for user authentication systems.
